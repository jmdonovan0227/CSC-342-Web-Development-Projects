# Homework 0: Thoughts on Ungrading

## 1. What are your thoughts on the Ungrading practice as it applies in general to teaching and learning (not necessarily specifically to this class)?

I like the idea of it as it encourages students to put their best work out because they aren't receiving a normal letter grade for assignment. What I mean is that a student is encouraged to push past the requirements for assignments in courses as it could be used as leverage when arguing for a final grade at the end of the semester. It also reduces some stress with classes as well, because if you do bad on assignment it won't hit your grade in moodle but of course will still have to factor in when deciding final grades at the end of the semester. It personally stresses me out looking at a failing grade in moodle which is a nice benefit to this class in the event I bomb one of the assignment early on. 

## 2. What are your thoughts on the way Ungrading will be applied to this class based on what has been explained by your instructor and what is described in the syllabus?

I think it is a good system. I do think that it heavily relies on trust between the students and instructor and can be good as students will most likely know what a good grade would be based on their work quality of the semester. I would say though that if there is any doubt what grade a student should have for the course to ask, because it would not be a good time getting an academic integrity violation if you rate yourself too high on accident.

## 3. On the scale from 1 to 5, how confident are you in that you can earn an A in this class (1 is lowest, 5 is highest)?

**4**, because I am very confident I can get an A but sometimes semesters can get busy and it is possible I make some mistakes but I am extremely confident in my ability to get an A in CSC 342.
