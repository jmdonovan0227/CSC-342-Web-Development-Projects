# Homework 1 - Static Websites

## [Go Back](../README.md)

## How To Run

    1) Open a terminal in VSCode by selecting 'Terminal' and selecting 'New Terminal' or open a git bash terminal (where you have stored this git repo).
    2) Next, use 'cd Project1' to navigate inside of the project 1 folder.
    3) Next, build a docker image with the command 'docker compose up --build' (if you have already down this before, just type 'docker compose up')
    4) Wait a few moments until the terminal prints some output and can you see that our project is running on localhost:80
    5) In your browser of choice, type 'localhost:80'. The default project is p1. To view these html pages, click on part 1 or part 2 links. Other projects can also be accessed from this point by appending '/p#' => ex: localhost:80/ takes you to p1 by default as '/' is the default path. So to go to p2 => type this link in your browser => locahost:80/p2.

## Description

- **Part 1** of this project consists of using HTML and CSS to create a static landing page for a hypothetical newspaper website. Part 1 of the project includes a single HTML file called landing.html, 3 images for the webpage, 3 links connected to images and text, a css file that includes a google font, and flexbox and CSS grid for styling.
- **Part 2** of this project involves styling a dashboard with CSS. In this part of the project, we have a dashboard.html file that we styled to look more professional using CSS grid and flexbox as well as class/id attributes to connect HTML elements to CSS styling.
