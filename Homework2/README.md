Challenging assignment. It took me a while writing all of the JavaScript, but I think I covered the requirements based on what I read in the writeup (hopefully didnt miss anything). I also tested again the test cases as well to make sure everything seems okay and it passed the basic tests. It also can continue a calculation when multiple operators are selected and can negate numbers as well. It will not print another value to the history if the user clicks equal twice.
